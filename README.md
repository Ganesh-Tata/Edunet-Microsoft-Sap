The code processes PDF resumes and job descriptions (JDs) using the Gemini API to simulate an Applicant Tracking System (ATS). It extracts text from resumes with PyPDF2, then constructs a prompt for Gemini to calculate a "JD Match" percentage, identify "Missing Keywords," and generate a "Profile Summary." The analysis leverages Gemini's semantic understanding to recognize related skills, not just exact matches. Results are returned in JSON format for easy parsing and display via a Streamlit web interface. This tool helps job seekers optimize their resumes in a competitive job market, particularly for tech-specific roles.
